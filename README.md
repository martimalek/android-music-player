# MusicPlayah
A music player application developed with React Native.

## Introduction

**Who doesn't enjoy music?** I personally listen to music every single day at least twice while walking my dog. At some point I became tired of **Spotify**'s interruption of your music with non-premium accounts, so instead of paying the measly amount asked by Spotify and getting an endless stream of music in question of seconds I decided to do something much easier... building my own custom music player application.... it couldn't be that difficult... right?

... One week later ...

\- Oh oh...

... Two weeks later ...

\- (Scratching head motion with a heavy sigh) Hmmm, too late to back out I guess...

## Current state of the project

**This is a work-in-progress project**

Some of the features intended:
- [x] Retrieving songs from the phone's memory
- [x] Main song queue
- [x] Playback management (play/pause/next/prev/changing song)
- [x] Very basic UI showing songs and playback state
- [x] Alternative song queue with user-picked songs from the main queue
- [ ] UI for the alternative queue
