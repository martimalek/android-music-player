# MusicPlayah
A music player application developed with React Native.

## Introduction

**Who doesn't enjoy music?** I personally listen to music every single day at least twice while walking my dog. At some point I became tired of **Spotify**'s interruption of your music with non-premium accounts, so instead of paying the measly amount asked by Spotify and getting an endless stream of music in question of seconds I decided to do something much easier... building my own custom music player application.... it couldn't be that difficult... right?

... One week later ...

\- Oh oh...

... Two weeks later ...

\- (Scratching head motion with a heavy sigh) Hmmm, too late to back out I guess...

## Current state of the project

**This is a work-in-progress project**

Some of the features intended:
- [x] Retrieving songs from the phone's memory
- [x] Main song queue
- [x] Playback management (play/pause/next/prev/changing song)
- [x] Very basic UI showing songs and playback state
- [x] Alternative song queue with user-picked songs from the main queue
- [ ] UI for the alternative queue
- [ ] Retrieving songs from the cloud

## Caveats

### Android only

This is an application built for myself, basically I'm (AFAIK) the only user of it, and I have an Android, so there's no reason to create an iOS version, even though React Native makes building multi-platform apps easier some work needs to be put for each platform. At the same time in order to build a product for **Apple** users you have to be an **Apple** user yourself, and I'm not (Android phone and Linux laptop).
